  "articleLead": "Living in Ch√≠a and the Bogot√° Savanna is a privilege: fresh air, green landscapes, and a peaceful environment surround us. However, our hair often pays the price for this unique climate. The altitude, solar radiation, humidity, and temperature changes can leave it dry, brittle, and frizzy. At Narbo's Sal√≥n Spa, we understand these challenges perfectly. That's why we've created a guide with the 5 key treatments your hair needs to look spectacular all year round.",
  "articleH2_1": "1. Deep Hydration: An Oasis for Your Hair",
  "articleP1": "Dryness is the number one enemy in our climate. A professional deep hydration treatment is like giving a glass of water to your thirsty hair. At Narbo's, we use intensive masks with ingredients like hyaluronic acid and natural oils that penetrate the hair fiber, restoring its elasticity, shine, and lost softness. We recommend this treatment at least once a month to maintain a healthy mane.",
  "articleH2_2": "2. Hair Reconstruction Therapy: Goodbye to Brittle Hair",
  "articleP2": "The high-altitude UV radiation weakens the internal structure of the hair, making it prone to breakage. Our reconstruction treatments based on keratin and amino acids act as a \"scaffold\" for the hair fiber, filling in fissures and strengthening the hair from within. It is the ideal treatment if you feel your hair is weak, porous, or has undergone chemical processes such as bleaching.",
  "articleH2_3": "3. Anti-Frizz Keratin Treatment: Control and Softness without Sacrificing Volume",
  "articleP3": "The humidity of the savanna can make even the most disciplined hair unruly. A gentle keratin treatment (different from permanent straightening) is the perfect solution. This procedure seals the hair cuticle, creating a protective barrier against the humidity that causes frizz. The result is more manageable, soft, and shiny hair, without sacrificing its natural shape.",
  "articleH2_4": "4. Hair Detox: A New Beginning for Your Scalp",
  "articleP4": "The accumulation of products, pollution, and dead cells can \"suffocate\" the scalp, affecting hair growth and health. Our hair detox is a deep cleanse that gently exfoliates, removes impurities, and balances oil production. A healthy scalp is the foundation for strong and radiant hair.",
  "articleH2_5": "5. Color Protection with Cuticle Sealer",
  "articleP5": "If you have colored hair, you know that the savanna sun can make the color fade quickly. After your coloring service at Narbo's, we apply a cuticle sealing treatment. This final step not only adds spectacular shine but also creates a protective shield that prolongs the life of your color, keeping it vibrant for longer.",
  "articleBlockquote": "\"At Narbo's Sal√≥n Spa, we don't just apply treatments; we create experiences. Each service is personalized to the unique needs of your hair and your lifestyle in Ch√≠a.\"",
